 * NOTE: This screen shouldn't be used as an example since we don't generally recommend mixing multiple profilers.
 * Nested profilers only make sense when transitioning between JS and native layers in a hybrid use case.
 * For example, in brown-field apps, gradually adopting React Native.
 * Please stick with only profiler per App if there is no serious matter to do otherwise.
