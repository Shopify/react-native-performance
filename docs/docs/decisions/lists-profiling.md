As part of the [FlashList](https://github.com/shopify/flash-list) project, we have created a set of tools and components to be used for profiling lists. As the profiling was not constrained to the `FlashList` component itself but works with `FlatList` and potentially with any other lists, we have decided to migrate the code to this repository.

This repository will also include a Flipper plugin that is used for visualizing the profiling results.
