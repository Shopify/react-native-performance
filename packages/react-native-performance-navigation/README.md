# react-native-performance-navigation

This package contains some additional higher-order profilers that we anticipate most apps would find helpful, as well as `ReactNavigationPerformanceView`, built on top of vanilla `PerformanceMeasureView` with the addition of optimizations for [React Navigation library](https://reactnavigation.org/).

## Usage & installation

Please refer to [documentation](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-performance/docs/guides/react-native-performance-navigation/getting-started) to see more information and usage examples.
