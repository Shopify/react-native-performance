# React Native Performance Docs

Welcome to our docs! 👋

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/) and is published on [react-native-performance.docs.shopify.io](https://react-native-performance.docs.shopify.io).

## Installation and Local Development

Note: make sure you are in the `documentation` folder prior to performing the commands below

```bash
dev up        # installs the dependencies
dev server    # builds the website and serves it locally
dev open      # opens the website on a browser
```

You should then have a local development server up and running and the website open in browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```bash
dev build     # builds a production version of the website
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and serves it locally for testing.

## Deploy

Changes to the this folder should be automatically published once they land on the `main` branch.
